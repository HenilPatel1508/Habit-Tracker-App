# habit-tracker

*A habit-tracking tool for the University of Helsinki Fullstack project course.*



## Ideas for Further Development

- Revamped database structure
- More statistics
- Popular habits?
- React Native application

## Deficiencies

- Literally no automated testing whatsoever
- Code should be better documented
